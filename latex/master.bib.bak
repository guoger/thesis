  Abstract                 = {Abstract—Internet-scale distributed systems such as content delivery networks (CDNs) operate hundreds of thousands of servers deployed in thousands of data center locations around the globe. Since the energy costs of operating such a large IT infras- tructure are a significant fraction of the total operating costs, we argue for redesigning CDNs to incorporate energy optimizations as a first-order principle. We propose techniques to turn off CDN servers during periods of low load while seeking to balance three key design goals: maximize energy reduction, minimize the impact on client-perceived service availability (SLAs), and limit the frequency of on-off server transitions to reduce wear-and-tear and its impact on hardware reliability. We propose an optimal offline algorithm and an online algorithm to extract energy savings both at the level of local load balancing within a data center and global load balancing across data centers. We evaluate our algorithms using real production workload traces from a large commercial CDN. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption of a CDN by 51% while ensuring a high level of availability that meets customer SLA requirements and incurring an average of one on-off transition per server per day. Further, we show that keeping even 10% of the servers as hot spares helps absorb load spikes due to global flash crowds and minimize any impact on availability SLAs. Finally, we show that redistributing load across highly proximal data centers can enhance service availability significantly, but has only a modest impact on energy savings.},

Content Delivey Networks (CDNs) have shortly appeared as a distributed solution to serve content faster than contacting a centralized server. Their effectiveness has been showed by larger com panies such as Akamai and Speedera. However, there is currently a certain gap about implementations issues of this technology, and only arquitectural designs and performance reports are published. This article tries to describe a CDN from a different point of view, paying much attention on the implementation process of a CDN.},
